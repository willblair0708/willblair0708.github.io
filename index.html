I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and humanity — the ways in which technology shapes and will continue to shape our lives, and how we may harness it for the better. <br/><br/>I bring a strong technical background in both theory and practice, currently working as an APM at Uber on Driver Experience. I graduated from Harvard with a dual Bachelor&#39;s-Master&#39;s degree in Applied Math and Computer Science, and I have taken on several Software Engineering internships in industry, including at Facebook and Mastercard.<br/><br/>At the same time, I am greatly focused on people and impact.

We used Twilio to create an accessible phone number that users can text. A server running on Microsoft Azure is set up to listen to the webhooks associated with this phone number and will pull any new text messages from Twilio. These texts are parsed and new application instances are started. A core framework is provided that will provide the parsed commands to an application which can do anything a normal internet-connected application would do, and will return the application&#39;s results to the user via text messages. On the developer end, we created a full featured web-based IDE and app store that provide developers with an area to create applications on top of our core framework and immediately deploy them to AWS courtesy of real-time syncing via Firebase. standardizedContributor Colin King ✌️ Algorithms CMSC351 Applied Probability and Statistics STAT400 Applied Probability and Statistics II STAT401 Calculus III MATH241 Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications Computer Science Honors Seminar CMSC396H Developing Data Products 8 2012 5 2014 Calculus, Physics and Chemistry Tutor Towson High School EDUCATION Amazon Web Services (AWS) Leadership Gannon Portal Scholarship This scholarship recognizes outstanding computer science undergraduates early in their studies.

Once the user was finished, we developed a method for automatically converting the drawn content into HTML using a cutting-edge CSS grid system and completely scripted  the process of deploying to AWS. standardizedContributor Colin King ✌️ Mobile Education Hub 5 2015 5 2015 Awarded: 3rd Place and KPCB Build for Good Challenge<br/><br/>The Mobile Education Hub was a hackathon project built at RevolutionUC (University of Cincinnati&#39;s annual MLH-sponsored hackathon). This project addresses a &quot;Build-for-Good&quot;​ challenge released by KPCB and Pencils of Promise. Pencils of Promise is an organization that makes tremendous impact by vastly improving education in developing communities throughout the world. This hub allows Pencils of Promise educators to create innovative and interactive multimedia courses using the OpenEdx platform. This hub does not rely on the internet, so it is well-fit for 3rd world countries where a lack of a reliable connection is commonplace. Instead, the hub is designed to spread courses via it&#39;s own local area network. Each hub is made up of a Raspberry Pi B+ running a custom-made OpenEdx image and an Arduino hooked to a GSM modem to create SMS-based discussion forums. Each hub is completely self-operational and can function without anything other than a power source (which can come in the form of solar power). standardizedContributor Colin King ✌️ standardizedContributor Hiroshi Furuya Trustees Doctoral Fellow at University of Central Florida Discrete Structures CMSC250 Exploratory Data Analysis Foundations in Cybersecurity HACS100 Foundations in Cybersecurity II HACS102 Intro to Computer Science II - Summer class at Towson University Introduction to Computer Systems CMSC216 Introduction to Statistical Computing with SAS STAT430 MongoDB for Node.js Developers M101JS Object-Oriented Programming II CMSC132 Oral Communication INAG110 Organization of Programming Languages CMSC330 Practical Machine Learning R Programming Project Management Swift OCaml Objective-C HTML CSS C Cybersecurity Software Engineering React Best Use of Intel Edison Development System at PennApps XI (SmartCan) PennApps is the premier student-run college hackathon.

Hacks were made based off of problem statements submitted by charities and other organizations in order to focus hacks on real world problems. My team worked to tackle the lack of safe, anonymous and secure methods for Bangladesh workers to report unfair and potentially dangerous working conditions. Workers are able to text a number with a complaint and a natural language version of their location and this will be saved in our Firebase database where it is accessed from and displayed on our Node.js site that Federation/Union leaders can access. This allows these leaders to anonymously view complaints and respond in an adequate matter.

I post about the future of news and information -- the problems with the current options, and how we can fix them.<br/><br/>A summary of my experiences that have taught me about this industry:<br/>• Co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Shades (https://shades.news), the future of news &amp; information.<br/>• Seed/angel investor and Sequoia Capital Scout (24 total investments since 2016).<br/>• Previously Group Product Manager at Google growing Discover Feed Ads business from scratch to Google-scale revenue.<br/>• Personal projects: iOS developer of four apps on App Store totaling 430,000 total downloads.<br/>• Dual degrees from from UPenn&#39;s Jerome Fisher Program in Management &amp; Technology (M&amp;T): B.S.

Electrochromic materials that readily change color as a function of voltage are ideal candidates for dynamic window applications. Unfortunately, these materials have yet to be widely commercialized due to complications and tradeoffs associated with color, switching speed, durability, and cost. In this work, we study the reversible metal electrodeposition of Bi and Cu on a Pt-functionalized transparent conducting electrode for high-quality dynamic windows. We develop a stoichiometrically optimized electrolyte formula to construct 25 cm2 electrochromic devices with bistable, reversibly tunable transmission at fast switching speeds. Our results show improved deposition uniformity and sheet resistance achieved with the Pt-modified cathode, and our colorless electrolyte enables great optical performance. Altogether, our windows demonstrate uniform switching between a clear state, with over 70% transmission, and a color-neutral black state, with under 15% transmission. Additionally, our electrochromic devices can be cycled in less than one minute, demonstrating a significant improvement over previous metal-based dynamic window architectures. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford &#39;19 Handwritten Mathematics to LaTeX Code 4 2018 6 2018 In this study, we present a fully end-to-end, deep learning pipeline capable of generating the LaTeX code associated with an input mathematical image. The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture with integrated visual and semantic attention mechanisms. For model training, we leverage a rich dataset of over 100,000 LaTeX images linked to their ground truth markup. Metrics such as Levenshtein distance and BLEU score were used to assess performance and compare between models. We managed to achieve a BLEU score of 56% and image edit accuracy of 48%. Our image-to-LaTeX system could benefit students, researchers, and professors alike by saving them valuable time spent transcribing work from paper to PDF. Such a system might aid in the development of next-generation grading systems and artificially intelligent notetakers for students with documented disabilities. With sufficient data, our model could be applied more generally to convert images of other languages, such as handwritten python or C++, into valid markup. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford &#39;19 18583501 Stealth Startup https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQH03e0VowA5sQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1523260171056?e=1698278400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=zaqVFlaN7QK4gjWPKqkCO5gohtCvSuXdQPfw6aVzXsc https://www.linkedin.com/company/stealth-startup-51/ 11 50 6 2022 San Francisco Bay Area 6 2022 Stealth Startup Founder Full-time Research Solar Cells Statistics Electronics Data Analysis Optimization Machine Learning C++ True 1049 500 michellehpark Michelle Park Cofounder &amp; CEO at [stealth] | Stanford AI https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQEDqHhhrnBpTg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1602282715297?e=1695859200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=adxt1ikRMGCG5_IUYxaJFUAbe0QF_1bJpTriDuO7_Zg mitch-adler-2435a9b Mitch Adler Founder @ Stealth Startup https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGNs6kARCnhrw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1535432868099?e=1695859200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=kkXUgSePPb5dY0CY7S27USDz0OgVCO-vGOQcPTN9b7g davidgudeman David Gudeman Entrepreneur, Engineer https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQEimb_hEwGqkw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1625178406533?e=1695859200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=eu1GPNi0sUz_qzJ7lpVI-UMMUYzvtRp0DGtYAL2DBKk iantolee Han L.

Quantitative Researcher at Citadel Securities Prediction of Cellular Service Quality 10 2016 12 2017 Used ordinary least squares, support vector regression, and random forest regression to predict the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of mobile devices. Achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 15.5 dB on RSSI test data ranging from 0 to 250 dB in magnitude.<br/><br/>Current mobile devices can tell us when a cell signal or WiFi connection is weak; however, they fail to provide useful information for obtaining a better signal. A compact machine learning model, capable of predicting RSSI from real-time network conditions and location measurements, could provide mobile device users with a personal heuristic for locating areas of optimal cell service.<br/><br/>This could also benefit cell service providers in determining a favorable deployment of cell towers over a region. As cell carrier companies work to improve their coverage by using insights obtained via this predictive algorithm, periodically retraining the model to reflect these targeted improvements results in a positive feedback loop to benefit mobile device users all over the world. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford &#39;19 Tetris AI 9 2017 12 2017 In this project, we take a reinforcement learning approach to play the game of Tetris. By modeling the game states in terms of the board and current tetromino, we use TD Learning and genetic algorithms to determine an evaluation function for picking the best possible move at each step. We built six different agents to test combinations of depth-k search, feature selection, TD learning, and genetic algorithms. Our top-performing model was depth-2 search using the evaluation function found by genetic algorithm. This model was able to clear over 6,000 lines, beating out even the best human players. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford &#39;19 Applied Matrix Theory MATH 104 Applied Quantum Mechanics EE 222, 223 Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques CS 221 Circuits EE 101A, 101B Computer Organization and Systems CS 107 Computers, Ethics, and Public Policy CS 181W Convex Optimization EE 364A C# Python H.
